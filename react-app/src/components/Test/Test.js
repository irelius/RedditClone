                    The universe does not find us significant, even if it could contemplate our meager existence.
                    We are too small for it to notice us, but the reverse is true for the universe to us.
                    13.7 billion years is a very long time. So long that we cannot being to understand it. We reduce that age, that experience, that scope to
                    a number. A concept. With a gap in that understanding, is it not true to say that the universe does not matter to us?
                    You may say that what the celestial bodies do from one minute to another does matter; it does have significance. But I would ask,
                    other that the fact that we choose to make it matter to us, why? What does an asteroid, a million lightyears away, flying towards a planeet,
                    a hundred million lightyears further, matter to us?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why ask the universe if we matter when it does not matter to us?
                    There is a gap of understanding that cannot be bridge.
                    Do not elevate your standing to something like the universe if you will not elevate the standing of a dust particle to yours.
                    Do you matter to your friends, family, and enemies?
                    Do you matter to yourself?
                    Does that not matter?
